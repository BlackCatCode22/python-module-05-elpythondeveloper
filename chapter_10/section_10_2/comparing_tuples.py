# Chapter 10 - Tuples
# 10.2 Comparing tuples

# File: comparing_tuples.py

# Example 1 - Compare two tuples, (0, 1, 2) and (0, 3, 4), using the less-than operator <.
# ----- Comparison 1 -----
# It starts by comparing the first elements of both tuples: 0 and 0.
# Since 0 is equal to 0, the comparison moves to the next elements.
# ----- Comparison 2 -----
# It then compares the second elements: 1 and 3.
# Here, 1 is less than 3.
# As soon as Python finds an element in the first tuple that is less
# than the corresponding element in the second tuple, it determines
# that the first tuple is less than the second tuple, and it returns True.
print((0, 1, 2) < (0, 3, 4))
