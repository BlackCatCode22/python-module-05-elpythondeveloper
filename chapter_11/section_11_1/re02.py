# Chapter 11 - Regular expressions
# 11.1 Character matching in regular expressions

# File: re02.py
# Description - Search the text file mbox-short.txt for lines that star with From
#               using a regular expression. The regular expression module re
#               must be imported into your program before you can use it.
#               The simplest use of the regular expression module is the search() function

# Search for lines that start with From
# Import the re module, which provides regular expression operations.
import re
# Open the file mbox-short.txt and assign the file handle to hand.
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
# Iterate through each line in the opened file.
for line in hand:
    # Remove trailing whitespace characters (like newline) from the line.
    line = line.rstrip()
    # Check if the line starts with From:
    # The ^ character anchors the match to the beginning of the line.
    if re.search('^From:', line):
        # If the regular expression is found, print the line to the console.
        print(line)
