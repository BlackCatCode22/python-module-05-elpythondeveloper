# Chapter 11 - Regular expressions
# 11.3 Combining searching and extracting

# File: re10.py
# Description - Read all the lines in a text file using a regular expression.

# Search for lines that start with X
# followed by any non whitespace characters
# and ':' # followed by a space and any number.
# The number can include a decimal.
# Import the re module, which provides regular expression operations.
import re
# Open the file mbox-short.txt and assign the file handle to hand.
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
# Iterate through each line in the opened file.
for line in hand:
    # Remove trailing whitespace characters (like newline) from the line.
    line = line.rstrip()
    # Check if the line matches the following pattern:
    # Starts with X ('^X')
    # Followed by zero or more non-whitespace characters ('\S*')
    # Followed by a colon and a space (': ')
    # Followed by one or more digits or periods ('[0-9.]+')
    # The r prefix indicates a raw string, preventing backslash escape issues.
    if re.search(r'^X\S*: [0-9.]+', line):
        # If the regular expression is found, print the line to the console.
        print(line)
