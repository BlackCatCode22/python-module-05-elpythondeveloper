# Chapter 11 - Regular expressions
# 11.3 Combining searching and extracting

# File: re12.py
# Description - Read all the lines in a text file using a regular expression.
#               Extract all the revision numbers (the integer numbers at the end of the lines)

# Search for lines that start with X followed by any
# non whitespace characters and : followed by a space
# and any number. The number can include a decimal.
# Then print the number if it is greater than zero.
# Import the re module, which provides regular expression operations.
import re
# Open the file mbox-short.txt and assign the file handle to hand.
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
# Iterate through each line in the opened file.
for line in hand:
    # Remove trailing whitespace characters (like newline) from the line.
    line = line.rstrip()
    # Find all occurrences that match the following pattern and capture the revision number in a group:
    # Starts with Details: ('^Details:')
    # Followed by any characters ('.*')
    # Followed by rev=
    # Followed by one or more digits ('([0-9]+)') -
    # The parentheses create a capturing group, capturing the revision number.
    # Store the captured group(s) (revision numbers) in the list x.
    x = re.findall('^Details:.*rev=([0-9]+)', line)
    # Check if the length of the list x is greater than 0,
    # meaning at least one match was found.
    if len(x) > 0:
        # If matches were found, print the list x to the console
        # (which will contain the captured revision numbers).
        print(x)
