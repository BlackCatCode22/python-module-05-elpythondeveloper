# Chapter 11 - Regular expressions
# 11.4 Escape character

# File: escape_character.py
# Description - Indicate that we want to simply match a character by prefixing that character
#               with a backslash. Find money amounts with a regular expression.

# Import the re module, which provides regular expression operations.
import re
# Save a string in variable x.
x = 'We just received $10.00 for cookies.'
# y = re.findall('\$[0-9.]+',x)
# The r before the string makes it a raw string.
# \$ is treated as a literal dollar sign followed by [0-9.]+.
# Find all occurrences that match the following pattern:
# A literal dollar sign ('\$')
# Followed by one or more digits or periods ('[0-9.]+')
# Store the results (the matched dollar amounts) in the list 'y'.
y = re.findall(r'\$[0-9.]+', x)

print("Variable x contains this string:",x)
print("Variable y contains this list with one element:",y)
print(type(y))
print("Now we access the first element of list y and display it, it is this string:",y[0])
print(type(y[0]))
