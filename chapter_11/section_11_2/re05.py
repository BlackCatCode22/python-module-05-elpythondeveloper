# Chapter 11 - Regular expressions
# 11.2 Extracting data using regular expressions

# File: re05.py
# Description - Uses findall() to find all email addresses in a string
#               and extract the email addresses from the string and save then in a string list
#               then display the string list to the console.
# Output:
# ['csev@umich.edu', 'cwen@iupui.edu']

# If we want to extract data from a string in Python we can use the findall()
# method to extract all of the substrings which match a regular expression.

# Import the re module, which provides regular expression operations.
import re
# save a string in variable s
s = 'A message from csev@umich.edu to cwen@iupui.edu about meeting @2PM'
# Find all occurrences of one or more non-whitespace characters (\S+)
# followed by an @ symbol,
# followed by one or more non-whitespace characters \S+.
# Store the results in the list called lst.
lst = re.findall(r'\S+@\S+', s)
# print the list lst to the console.
print(lst)
