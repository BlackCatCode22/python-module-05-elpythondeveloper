# Chapter 11 - Regular expressions
# 11.2 Extracting data using regular expressions

# File: re06.py
# Description - Read all the lines in a text file and
#               print out anything that looks like an email address

# Search for lines that have an at sign between characters
# Import the re module, which provides regular expression operations.
import re
# Open the file mbox-short.txt and assign the file handle to hand.
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
# Iterate through each line in the opened file.
for line in hand:
    # Remove trailing whitespace characters (like newline) from the line.
    line = line.rstrip()
    # Find all occurrences of one or more non-whitespace characters (\S+)
    # followed by an @ symbol,
    # followed by one or more non-whitespace characters \S+.
    # Store the results in the list x.
    # The r prefix indicates a raw string, preventing backslash escape issues.
    x = re.findall(r'\S+@\S+', line)
    # Check if the length of the list x is greater than 0
    # which means at least one match was found.
    if len(x) > 0:
        # If matches were found, print the list x to the console.
        print(x)
